# OurSpaceTechBlog
A space for coders to blog and exchange ideas

I have developed a fully functional dynamic blogging site using handlebars as a template engine while still including aspects of native JS. OurSpace provides the user with the ability to register for the site and log in to view their dashboard. Once logged in the user is able to post to the blog and also leave comments on others posts. From the main page you can view all posts but from the user dashboard you can only see your own. For design we incorporated bootstrap to allow a clean user friendly look.
